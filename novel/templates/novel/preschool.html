		<p>Our preschool campus in community 25 is located
			just a few steps away from our main campus.</p>

		<p>Admissions are for ages 1 – 5.
			From here, they move on to primary school.</p>


		<p>It is our goal to support independence and encourage personal responsibility. We achieve this by giving children opportunities to explore movement, dress up by themselves, choose what they want to do and under adult supervision, perform challenging tasks that will develop and stretch their imagination.</p>

		<p>When they are able to achieve this, there is an increase in their self-belief, self-confidence and self-esteem that they will need for life.</p>
